# (Investigate a Dataset- No-show Apointments )
## by (Oloruntoba James Moritiwon)


## Dataset

The dataset analysed is associated with 100k medical appointments in Brazil. Each rows of the dataset contain descriptions about patients which include chosen days of appointment, location of hospital and Bolsa Fam√≠lia (Brazillian welfare program) enrollment status. The dataset contained 110527 observations and 14 variables which changed to 110526 and 15 respectively after wrangling. The dataset can be found on Kaggle servers- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/download?datasetVersionNumber=5


## Summary of Findings

Assessing the ``.csv`` file imported into Dataframe ``df``, it can be seen that the total number of appointment identities and schedules are a little less than double the number of patients documented. This implies that patients with more than one identities booked multiple schedules with medical personnels within the 27 days under scrutiny!. Also, there are several scheduled appointments per day for most of the 27 days under scrutiny. Furthermore, one negative entry is detected in the column representing the age of patients. This would require cleaning to make a realistic analysis. Sentence cased data headings are inconsistent with pythonic standards and would required conversion to lower case. Clumsy headings would need re-arrangement for clarity too.

This dataset is well structured and easy to manipulate. However, some constrains to the dataset include the minimal representation of some categories (there are only 7 centinarians compared to more than 12000 children!) to arrive at a viable conclusions.Also, exaggeratons are likely should graphical presentation be relied on its entirety (there are no male centinarians patients documented hence, they can neither show up nor miss appointments thereby, displaying a false zero for males on a graph!). Therefore, textual results should be used together with these graphs for better understandings. Conclusively, being female and younger in age indicates a strong likelyhood of keeping with schedules. However, not getting a medical sponsorship seemed to make more patients take their medical appointments seriouslly too.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For visualisations, I gave priority to age and its influence on patients' no-show behaviouur. Afterwards, I showed how the gender of patients can predict no-show behaviour in general, with age brackets and with how medical scholarship influence no-show behaviour of patients under study.  

I started with the barchart of no_show appointments with age, and went further to show the barh chart of no_show appointments by gender and age bracket. Finally, I showed the proportions of no-show for appoinyments by patient medical sponsorship with a pie chart. I have made sure to pass the right messages with colours for each variable clearly.
